Wordpress Plugin
================

Plugin Name: diCore

Description: diCore targets OOP developers, by introducing a new approach of writing code in wordpress, to trigger your code by wordpress hooks through the use of interfaces. For example, you need your code to be called when the 'register_activation_hook' is triggered, instead of using add_action and register your function, you just need to create a class that will implement one of the existing interfaces in diCore, such as IPlugin and that will do the trick. See also diCoreSample which shows how you can use diCore.
